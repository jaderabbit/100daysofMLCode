# 100 Days of ML Code
My log for #100daysofMLCode

## Day 0: 9th July 2018

- Decided on my first project: To program and train a GAN to generate album covers, using Keras
- This is to (a) Learn how GANs work (b) So I can teach others how to use a GAN to do cool stuff with them (got a presentation end of this month I'd like to have this ready for)
- Found & downloaded myself a [nice dataset](https://blog.archive.org/2015/05/27/experiment-with-one-million-album-covers/)
- Found a nice example of someone else who have used a DCGAN to generate album covers: https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code
- Found an example of the [DCGAN in Keras](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN#dcgan)
